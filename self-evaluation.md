How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

    I feel pretty confident... I just need to remember to use the square brackets instead of perenthesis, even when using a call back.

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

    I think everything seems pretty understandable.  I may just run another practice to get used to square brackets.

What questions do you have about Arrays?

    Is there a way to make variables automatically add into an array?
